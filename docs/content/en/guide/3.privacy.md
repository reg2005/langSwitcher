**Effective date: March 1, 2026**

::callout{icon="i-lucide-shield-check" color="green"}
**TL;DR:** LangSwitcher does not collect, transmit, or share any of your data. All text processing happens entirely on your Mac. No analytics, no telemetry, no network requests.
::

## 1. Data Collection

LangSwitcher does **not** collect any personal data:

- No text you type or convert is ever sent anywhere
- No usage analytics or telemetry are collected
- No crash reports are sent automatically
- No cookies, identifiers, or tracking of any kind
- The app makes **zero network requests**

## 2. Text Processing

When you press the hotkey, LangSwitcher reads the selected (or auto-detected) text from the current application using the macOS Accessibility API. The text is converted between keyboard layouts using a purely algorithmic, local computation. The converted text is then pasted back via the system clipboard. At no point does the text leave your Mac.

## 3. Conversion Log

The optional Conversion Log feature records your conversions for review and quality assessment:

- Stored in a **local SQLite database** on your Mac only
- Never transmitted or synced anywhere
- Fully under your control — view, export (JSON), or delete at any time from Settings
- Logging can be **completely disabled** in Settings

## 4. Accessibility Permission

LangSwitcher requires the macOS Accessibility permission exclusively to:

- Read selected text from the active application (via `AXUIElement`)
- Simulate keyboard events to select and replace text (via `CGEvent`)
- Detect the current keyboard layout (via `TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource`)

The Accessibility permission is **never** used to monitor your typing, log keystrokes, or access any data beyond what is needed for the conversion you explicitly trigger.

## 5. Third-Party Services

LangSwitcher uses **no third-party services**, SDKs, analytics frameworks, or external dependencies. Built entirely with Apple system frameworks (Swift, SwiftUI, AppKit, Carbon).

## 6. Data Storage

The only data stored by LangSwitcher:

- **User preferences** (hotkey, conversion mode, language) — stored in standard macOS `UserDefaults`
- **Conversion log** (if enabled) — stored in a local SQLite file within the app's sandbox container

Both are fully under your control and removed when you uninstall the app.

## 7. Open Source

LangSwitcher is open source under the [MIT License](https://github.com/reg2005/langSwitcher/blob/main/LICENSE). You can inspect the complete source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/reg2005/langSwitcher) to verify that no data collection occurs.

## 8. Changes

If this privacy policy is updated, changes will be published on this page with an updated effective date.
