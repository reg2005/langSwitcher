## Default Hotkey: Double Shift

By default, LangSwitcher uses **Double Shift** (⇧⇧) — press the Shift key twice quickly. This is the same hotkey used by popular layout switchers.

The double-press speed threshold is configurable in Settings.

## Custom Hotkey

You can record any custom keyboard shortcut:

1. Open **Settings** → **Hotkey** tab
2. Click the **Record** button
3. Press your desired key combination (e.g., `⌘+Shift+Space`)
4. The new hotkey is saved immediately

Avoid using shortcuts that conflict with system-wide or app-specific hotkeys (e.g., `⌘+C`, `⌘+V`).

## How It Works

When the hotkey is triggered:

1. LangSwitcher reads the selected text (or uses Smart Conversion to auto-select)
2. Detects the current keyboard layout and the source layout of the text
3. Converts each character from the source to the target layout map
4. Pastes the converted text back via the clipboard
5. Restores the original clipboard contents

The entire process takes milliseconds and works in any application.
