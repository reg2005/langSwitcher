LangSwitcher currently supports **6 keyboard layouts**. Layouts are auto-detected from your system keyboard settings — no manual configuration needed.

## Layout Table

| Layout | Language | Type | Example |
|--------|----------|------|---------|
| U.S. / ABC | English (EN) | QWERTY | `hello world` |
| Russian | Russian (RU) | ЙЦУКЕН | `привет мир` |
| Ukrainian | Ukrainian (UK) | ЙЦУКЕН (UA) | `привіт світ` |
| German | German (DE) | QWERTZ | `hallo welt` |
| French | French (FR) | AZERTY | `bonjour monde` |
| Spanish | Spanish (ES) | QWERTY (ES) | `hola mundo` |

## How Detection Works

LangSwitcher uses `TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource` to detect which keyboard layouts are currently enabled in your system. When you press the hotkey, it:

1. Identifies the **current active layout** (what you're typing in now)
2. Analyzes the selected text to determine the **source layout** (what it looks like it was typed in)
3. Converts character-by-character using physical key position mapping

## Adding More Layouts

More layouts will be added in future versions. If you need a specific layout, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/reg2005/langSwitcher/issues) with the layout name and character map.

LangSwitcher is open source — you can add a new layout by creating a `LayoutCharacterMap` in `Sources/Services/LayoutMapper.swift` and submitting a pull request.
