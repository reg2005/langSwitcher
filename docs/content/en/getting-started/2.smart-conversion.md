---

Smart Conversion lets you convert text **without manually selecting it** first. LangSwitcher analyzes the current line and determines what needs to be converted.

## Modes

| Mode | Behavior | Best for |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Greedy Line** (default) | Selects to line start, scans right-to-left to find where the wrong layout begins, converts only the wrong portion | Most users — handles mixed-layout lines |
| **Last Word** | Auto-selects only the last typed word, converts if it looks like wrong layout | Quick single-word fixes |
| **Disabled** | Only works with explicit manual text selection | Full manual control |

## Greedy Line (Default)

This is the recommended mode. When you press the hotkey:

1. LangSwitcher selects all text from the cursor to the start of the line
2. Scans the text right-to-left looking for the boundary where wrong layout begins
3. Converts only the affected portion
4. Leaves correctly typed text untouched

**Example:**
```
You type:    Hello, ghbdtn rfr ltkf
Press ⇧⇧:   Hello, привет как дела
```

The English "Hello, " is preserved — only the gibberish part is converted.

## Last Word

Converts only the last word you typed. Useful when you notice a mistake immediately.

**Example:**
```
You type:    Сегодня lheu
Press ⇧⇧:   Сегодня друг
```

## Disabled

Smart Conversion is off. You must manually select text first, then press the hotkey. Only the selected text is converted.

## Changing the Mode

Open **Settings** (click menu bar icon → Settings) → **General** tab → select your preferred Smart Conversion mode from the dropdown.
